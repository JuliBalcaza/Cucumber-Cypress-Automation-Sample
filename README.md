# Cucumber-Cypress Automation Sample

## Overview
This repository contains a sample of my automation project, showcasing how I use Cucumber with Cypress to write end-to-end tests for web applications. The project is structured to facilitate maintainable and scalable test automation, with a focus on ease of use and efficient execution.

## Features Included
Login Form Automation: Tests for various login scenarios using the Page Object Model.
Try-It-Out Content: Automates testing for interactive content and ensures user interactions work as expected.

## Project Structure
cypress/e2e/features/: Contains the feature files written in Gherkin syntax.
login-cases.feature: Sample feature for testing login forms.

cypress/e2e/step-definitions/: Contains the step definitions for the feature files.

Step definitions map Gherkin steps to the test code executed by Cypress.

cypress.config.js: Cypress configuration file for setting up the environment.
package.json: Contains project dependencies such as Cypress, Cucumber preprocessor, etc.

## Running the Tests
- Install dependencies:
`npm install`

- Run the tests:
`npm run cypress:execution`

View the test results in the Cypress UI or generate reports using the built-in reporting tools.

## Note
This is a simplified version of a larger automation project, meant to demonstrate the setup and approach to automation with Cucumber and Cypress.
